# Weather-App
This app uses the Openweather API to display the weather in your area based on the location of your computer.
This is WPF application that was developed using Visual Studio 2022 preview using C#/XAML and the target framework is .NET 6
I have provided a Release folder which contains the code already compiled into an executable that can be ran.
You are free to download the code and run it on your local machine but you will have to first go to openweathermap.org/ and register for your own API key. Aftwards navigate to  the MainWindow.xaml.cs file and do a "find and replace" and replace the word "key" with your API key.
