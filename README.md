# Weather-App
This app uses the Openweather API to display the weather in Kenensaw,Georgia. I am unable to pay for the API to get the specific location of every computer
the application would run on so I just decided on setting it to Kennesaw,Georgia.
The Weather Image on the left is responsive to the weather in the area so check the app periodically and you should see a new picture whenever
the weather changes.
This is a WPF application that was developed in Visual Studio 2022 preview in combination with C#/XAML. The target framework is .NET 6.
I have provided a Release folder with this readme which contains the code already compiled into an executable that can be ran.
You are free to download the code and run it on your local machine but you will have to first go to openweathermap.org/ and register for your own API key. Aftwards navigate to  the MainWindow.xaml.cs file and do a "find and replace" and replace the word "key" with your API key.
